# Artifact: Standardizing Terminal Error Messages
**Date:** 2026-01-28
**Revision Sequence:** 1.0
**Reference Change:** Initial definition of terminal error standards.
**Revised From:** 
**Context:** Standardizing terminal error outputs to align with API status codes for improved cross-layer observability.

## Summary
This artifact documents the architectural decision to enforce HTTP status codes in all terminal error messages across the MyRVM ecosystem (Server, Edge, CV).

## Key Decisions / Logic
- **Consistency:** Aligning terminal outputs with HTTP status codes (4xx, 5xx) ensures engineers can quickly identify the failure category across different system boundaries.
- **Observability:** Facilitates easier automated parsing and human debugging of logs generated by Edge devices and CLI tools.
- **Mandatory Inclusion:** Every terminal error message MUST prefix or include the relevant HTTP code (e.g., `[500] Critical: GPIO failure`).

## The Output
The following rule has been added to `senior-engineer.md`:
> **Terminal Output Standards:** Every terminal error message MUST include a corresponding HTTP status code (e.g., [404], [500]) to maintain consistency with the API layer and facilitate rapid debugging.
